# Traffic Accident Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing traffic accident data to identify patterns and trends associated with:

- Weather conditions  
- Road surface conditions  
- Time of day  
- Day of the week  

The goal of the analysis is to uncover accident hotspots and understand contributing factors that may influence accident frequency.

---

## Problem Statement

Traffic accidents are influenced by multiple environmental and situational variables.  
Understanding these relationships can help improve road safety, optimize traffic management, and support data-driven decision making.

---

## Objectives

- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on traffic accident data  
- Identify temporal accident hotspots  
- Analyze accidents based on weather conditions  
- Analyze accidents based on road surface conditions  
- Visualize key patterns and trends  
- Derive actionable insights  

---

## Dataset

The dataset contains traffic accident records with attributes such as:

- Crash date and time  
- Weather condition  
- Roadway surface condition  
- Lighting condition  
- Crash type  
- Injury severity  
- Crash hour  
- Crash day of week  

---

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## Analysis Performed

### 1. Temporal Analysis
- Accidents by hour of the day  
- Accidents by day of the week  
- Identification of peak accident periods  

### 2. Weather Analysis
- Accident distribution across weather conditions  
- Comparative evaluation of environmental impact  

### 3. Road Condition Analysis
- Accident frequency by roadway surface condition  
- Assessment of driving surface influence  

### 4. Hotspot Visualization
- Heatmap of accidents (Day vs Hour)  
- Identification of high-risk periods  

---

## Key Insights

- Accident frequency varies significantly with time of day  
- Peak accidents observed during high traffic hours  
- Majority accidents occur in clear weather conditions (volume effect)  
- Road surface conditions influence accident distribution  

---

## Conclusion

The analysis highlights how traffic accidents correlate with temporal and environmental factors.  
These findings can support road safety improvements and traffic management strategies.

## Future Work

Potential extensions of this project include:

- Accident severity prediction using machine learning  
- Risk classification models  
- Clustering-based hotspot detection  
- Interactive dashboards
